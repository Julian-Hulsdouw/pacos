# Pacos
Pacos is a simple boilerplate

## Getting started
There are two ways to start your boilerplate:
* [Download the zip](https://github.com/Julian-Hulsdouw/pacos/archive/master.zip)
* Clone the repo: `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Julian-Hulsdouw/pacos.git`

###Import sass components
To import sass files simply user the import function

`@import "pacos/sass/reset"`

## Browser support
* Chrome latest
* Firefox latest
* Opera latest
* Safari latest
* IE latest
Pacos works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE11.
